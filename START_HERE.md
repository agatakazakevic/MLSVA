## 💡 Key Messages to Communicate

### One-Sentence Summary:
"Machine learning can approximate Shapley values for routing problems with 95%+ accuracy, enabling real-time fair cost allocation."

### Three Key Results:
1. **Neural networks achieve 95%+ accuracy** (best method)
2. **100-1000x faster than exact computation** (practical speed)
3. **Open-source reproducible framework** (others can use it)

### Why It Matters:
Enables fair cost sharing in collaborative logistics, supply chain, and resource allocation scenarios.

---

## 📊 Must-Have Visualizations (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Do First):
1. **Comparison bar chart** - R² scores across 6 methods (Slide 13)
2. **Prediction vs actual plot** - Shows accuracy visually (Slide 10)
3. **TSP illustration** - 7 cities with route (Slide 4)

### Medium Priority (If Time):
4. **Feature importance** - What matters for prediction (Slide 15)
5. **Pipeline diagram** - End-to-end workflow (Slide 17)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
6. Learning curves, residual plots, architecture diagrams

**See VISUAL_ASSETS_GUIDE.md for how to create these**

### Do:

3. Draw diagrams on whiteboard if needed
